## Projects
### [OutRed Games](https://outred.org)
I currently run and update daily an unblocked games website called [OutRed Games](https://outred.org). It has decent traffic and a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/outred) that you should totally join. You can find the repo here: [github.com/OutRed/outred-games-v3](https://github.com/outred/outred-games-v3).
### [BrainTease](https://braintease.outred.dev)
This is another unblocked games website that my brother is paying me to make for him, to save time I forked 3kh0's [website-v3](https://github.com/3kh0/website-v3) and changed the UI a bit. This is still in development and does not have a Discord server yet, but does have a repo [here](https://github.com/OutRed/BrainTease). Stay tuned and join the main [Discord server](https://discord.gg/outred) to stay updated!
